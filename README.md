# 🍪 Cookie Consent Modal

An interactive cookie-consent modal built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

This project humorously exaggerates unethical data-collection practices while demonstrating real-world frontend concepts like modals, timed UI updates, DOM manipulation, form handling, and dynamic content rendering.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a dramatic and playful “data consent” experience:

- A modal appears automatically 1.5 seconds after page load
- The close button is disabled initially
- The decline button playfully switches position when hovered
- Accepting the terms triggers a fake loading sequence
- The modal content updates dynamically in multiple stages
- The final message personalizes the response using the user's name

The experience is intentionally comedic while reinforcing core frontend development principles.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**
- Google Fonts (Roboto)

## ✨ Key Features

### ⏳ Delayed Modal Trigger

The modal automatically appears after a short delay, simulating real-world popups that activate after brief user interaction.

### 🔐 Controlled Close Button

The close button is disabled initially and only becomes active after the full interaction flow completes. This demonstrates UI state management.

### 🏃 Interactive Decline Button

The decline button reverses position on hover using Flexbox layout manipulation, creating a playful evasive effect.

### 📝 Form Handling with FormData

The form collects the user's name and email using modern JavaScript form-handling techniques. Submission is intercepted to prevent default page reload behavior.

### 🔄 Simulated Loading Experience

After submission:

- A loading animation appears
- The status text updates
- The modal transitions to a personalized confirmation message

This demonstrates asynchronous UI updates and staged content rendering.

### 🎭 Dynamic DOM Rendering

The modal content is replaced dynamically after form submission to simulate real-world application feedback states.
